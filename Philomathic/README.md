Philomathic is my firt web developement project.

It is a Math Quiz Web-D project, which is made with only HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript.

I also used a pre build JavaScript animation i.e. --> vanilla-tilt.js  (src:https://micku7zu.github.io/vanilla-tilt.js/ ) for a smooth 3D tilt animation.


This project was made for Children of age group 8-10 years. Who can build up there calculating speed by playing the quiz, it includes:
1) There will be 4 Options for every question.
2) you will be provided with a score of 1 at every correct answer.
3) there will be a time contraint of 1 min on you, as soon as the time goes off a popup will come up with your score.
